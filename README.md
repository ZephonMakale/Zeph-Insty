## Instagram Clone
This is my instagram clone application that displays posts and profiles of different users.

### Getting Started
Here are the things you need to install the software.

#### Prerequisites
* The text Editor. Eg Visual Studio
* Django App.
* Virtual Environment.
* 
#### Installing
Step 1
To get this project up and running you should start by having Python installed on your computer. The first step is to create a virtual environment to store your projects dependencies separately. You can install virtualenv with:
* pip install virtualenv
  
Step 2. 
Clone or download this repository and open it in your editor of choice. In a terminal (mac/linux) or windows terminal, run the following command in the base directory of this project:
* virtualenv venv
  
Step 3.
That will create a new folder env in your project directory. Next activate it with this command:
* source venv/bin/activate
  

Step 4.
Then install the app dependencies with:
* pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 5.
Now you can run the app with this command:
* python manage.py runserver

Note if you want to get some data out of the system, you will need create your own database.
## Running the tests
Django allows us to test our systems. To test the project system, you have to run the following commands:
* source env/bin/activate 
* python3.8 manage.py test post

## Deployment
To deploy this on a live system like Heroku Server, you have to install the heroku cli.
Sign up to Heroku.
Then install the Heroku Toolbelt. This is a command line tool that manages your Heroku apps
After installing the Heroku Toolbelt, open a terminal and login to your account:

* Add a Procfile in the project root;
* Add requirements.txt file with all the requirements in the project root;
* Add Gunicorn to requirements.txt;
* A runtime.txt to specify the correct Python version in the project root;
* Configure whitenoise to serve static files.
  
After editing the respective files and installations you have added, create the heroku app
* heroku create 
  
Create a postgres addon to your heroku app
* heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev

Log in to Heroku dashboard to access our app and configure it. Then push it to remote by running the following command:
* git push heroku master
## Built With
  * Python3.8 version
  * Django 3.1
